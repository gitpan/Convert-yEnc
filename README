Convert/yEnc version 1.00
======================

A yEnc decoder, with database of file parts

Convert::yEnc decodes yEncoded files and writes them to disk. File
parts are saved to a temporary directory; when all parts of a file
have been received, the completed file is moved to its final location.

Convert::yEnc maintains a database of partially received files, called
the RC database. The RC database is loaded from disk when a
Convert::yEnc object is created, and saved to disk when the object is
DESTROY'd.
